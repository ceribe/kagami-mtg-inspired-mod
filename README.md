# Kagami: MtG Inspired Mod

# Description

I started writing this mod even before starting my education at Univeristy so it was my first "real" programming project. 
In those dark times I have't used git yet, so sadly there is no commit history.
I have not tried compiling it since 2019 and I doubt that it would compile now, because TModLoader and Terraria went 
through some massive changes since then. ~~Code quality is at best poor, but not terrible~~ 
I changed my mind after looking at [Bag_Of_Eyes.cs](https://github.com/ceribe/kagami-mtg-inspired-mod/blob/master/Items/SummonItems/Bag_Of_Eyes.cs).
Code quality is terrible. The only reason as to why this is here is nostalgia and the fact that some sprites are quite good.

# Mod Description

Kagami is an MtG themed mod. Most of the content of this mod is related to Magic: the Gathering lore.
So far the mod is focused on Ravinica & Ixalan related content, but there are many items from other planes.
So far this mod adds:
- About 100 Items (legendary weapons, normal weapons, accesories, potions, ammo, utility items, hook and wings)
- 30 Buffs
- 9 Monsters
- 1 Boss (Nezahal, Primal Tide)
- 1 Pet
- New ways to permamently increase max HP
- 1 special starting item for players who enjoy challenges

Most of the legendary weapons are unobtainable ATM alongside with some other items.
Out of 10 Ravnican guilds, Orzhov, Boros and Simic themed items were added so far.
This mod supports Boss Checklist mod.

# TODO (Most likely never)

- Add next Guild's themed items and monsters
- Balance some of the items
- Rework Lightning Helix
- Rebalancing of some items
- Making all of the legendary items obtainable
